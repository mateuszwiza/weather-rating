# Weather Rating

This is the implementation of the Weather Rating - a method invented by Harry Geurts to numerically express the subjective perception of weather on a given day on a scale from 1 to 10. This implementation calculates the weather score for a number of days, based on the data from KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut).
